## Manage ebooks easily ##

Ever download any PDF/CHM files? Yes, I have many of them. It's hard to remember where they are and which book you read already.

I'd searched for years for a easy ebook manager, all I need is simple:

- Scan the folder and store the book names into a sqlite database (so you don't need to setup mysql)
- Search the books by name
- Set and save some information about the book
  - Is favor?
  - Reading status
  - Tags
  - Page number (or chapter number)
  - Comment 

Are those features meet your needs? That's all we have in this small software.

I'm using TideSDK, so it runs on Windows/Linux/Mac.
